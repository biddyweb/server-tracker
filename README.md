server-tracker
================

Keeping track of servers is always a very important, but typically challenging task. There are many companies out there are glad to take your metrics and display it back for you, for a price.

The idea of this tool is to collect metrics as well as logs from a large number of servers as well as front-ends such as iPhone or Android apps as well as web apps running in clients.

Main features are:

* Collection of "events", "metrics", and log records and storing them in MongoDB.
* Retrieving JMX data from java servers using the [jolokia](http://www.jolokia.org/) JXM bridge
* Rendering arbitrary wonderful graphs that tracks customer behavior, server performance, response times, etc.
