server-tracker
================

Keeping track of servers is always a very important, but typically challenging task. There are many companies out there are glad to take your metrics and display it back for you, for a price.

The idea of this tool is to collect metrics as well as logs from a large number of servers as well as front-ends such as iPhone or Android apps as well as web apps running in clients.

Main features are:

* Collection of "events", "metrics", and log records and storing them in MongoDB.
* Retrieving JMX data from java servers using the [jolokia](http://www.jolokia.org/) JXM bridge
* Rendering arbitrary wonderful graphs that tracks customer behavior, server performance, response times, etc.

Install & Run
----------------

In order to be able to install and execute the server-tracker, one must have both ``node.js`` and ``npm`` installed. There are many ways to get these two products install. One of them is to install them using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm):

```
git clone git://github.com/creationix/nvm.git ~/.nvm
. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm install v0.4.12
nvm alias default v0.4.12
```

In order for this to work one obviously need ``git`` as well as a compiler and other build essentials. The [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) github page is one of the sources that explain how to install these problems.

Once ``node.js`` and ``npm`` are availabe, the tracker can be installed using:

```
npm install server-tracker --mongodb:native
npm install server-tracker
```

The startup process fails miserably unless the tracker can connect to a mongo instance on the local server. Configuration data is loaded from there. In order to connect to a different instance, one has to start the server tracker directly using:

```
node_modules/server-tracker/bin/server-tracker myconf.json
```

The ``myconf.json`` file has to contain valid json that identifies the replication set to use, as in:

```
{
  "mongo" : {
    "replica-set" : [{
      "server" : "mongo1.jolira.com",
      "port" : 27017
    }, {
      "server" : "mongo2.jolira.com",
      "port" : 27017
    }, {
      "server" : "mongo3.jolira.com",
      "port" : 27017
    }]
  }
}
```

Submitting Data
----------------

Once the server is running, data can be submitted using ``/submit/events``. If the server runs on localhsot, the data can be submitted using ``http://localhost:3080/submit/events`` as the url.


The data has to be posted to this url. The content of the post should contain both "events" and log messages, as in:

```
{
  "events" : [ event1, event2, event3, ... ],
  "logs" : [ logRecord1, logRecord2, logRecord3, ... ]
}
```
